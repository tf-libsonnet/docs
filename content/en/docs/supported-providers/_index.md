`tf.libsonnet` maintains a collection of autogenerated libraries for a handful of Terraform providers. These are all
generated from the [tf-libsonnet/libgenerator](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/libgenerator) project.

Here is a list of maintained provider libraries and links to the relevant repository:

{{< supported-providers >}}

Note that the support status of the providers will vary depending on how much usage it gets from the community. You can
learn more about the status of provider support in [the README of the libgenerator
project](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/libgenerator#status-of-provider-support).

## Requesting a new provider library

Due to limited bandwidth, we do not default to generating and maintaining a library for all providers. However, we are
open to supporting any providers that will get active usage from the community.

If there is a provider you would like to see generated and maintained, you can open a pull request against the
`libgenerator` repository with the provider added to the [cfg/managed.json
config](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/libgenerator/blob/main/cfg/managed.json). During the PR process, we will
allocate a new repository to house the generated code and run the generator through the CI job to generate the new
library. From there, you can test the generated code to verify the changes.
